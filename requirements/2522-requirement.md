# Environment Configuration Reorganization Plan

## Action Items

- [x] 1. Verify project structure and Docker configuration
- [x] 2. Delete duplicate `.env` file in the `/api` directory
- [x] 3. Update the Dockerfile to remove hardcoded environment variables
- [x] 4. Verify docker-compose.yml configuration
- [x] 5. Update `/api/.env.example` with instructions for proper placement
- [x] 6. Add documentation about environment configuration approach
- [x] 7. Verify changes don't break application functionality

## Project Context

The Briefly project is a Telegram bot that integrates with Todoist tasks and iCal calendar events, using GPT for intelligent task grouping. It follows Clean Architecture principles with a specific folder structure and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Current Issues

- Duplicate `.env` files exist in both root directory and `/api` directory
- Environment variables are hardcoded in Dockerfile
- Lack of clear documentation on environment variable management

## Proposed Solution

We will implement a single source of truth for environment variables by:
1. Maintaining only one `.env` file in the root directory
2. Updating Docker configuration to use this single file
3. Removing hardcoded environment variables from the Dockerfile
4. Adding clear documentation for future maintenance

This approach ensures:
- Clean Architecture principles are followed
- Environment configuration is simplified
- Docker container configuration is properly maintained
- Easier project maintenance

## Implementation Details

Each action item will be executed carefully, ensuring no functionality is broken in the process.
