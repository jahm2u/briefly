# ICal Integration Issue Investigation and Resolution Plan

## Objective
Review the entire codebase to identify and fix errors in the recently implemented ical integration system.

## Action Items Checklist

- [x] **Initial Assessment**: Review the current codebase structure and identify key components
- [x] **Error Analysis**: Check logs, error messages, and identify specific failure points
- [x] **ICal Integration Review**: Examine the ical.js implementation and configuration
- [x] **Dependency Analysis**: Verify package.json and dependencies are correctly configured
- [ ] **Calendar Service Investigation**: Review calendar-related services and their implementations
- [ ] **Message Processing Review**: Check if message processing is affected by the ical changes
- [x] **Testing and Validation**: Run tests to identify specific errors
- [x] **Issue Resolution**: Fix identified problems systematically
- [x] **Integration Testing**: Verify fixes work end-to-end
- [x] **Documentation Update**: Update any relevant documentation

## Context
- Recently switched from `node-ical` to `ical.js` for better recurring event handling
- Users are experiencing "a lot of errors" after the integration
- Need to identify root causes and implement fixes

## Issues Found and Fixed
1. **Missing ical.js dependency** - Added `ical.js: "^2.0.1"` to package.json
2. **Test compatibility issues** - Updated all test files to use ical.js instead of node-ical
3. **Mock setup problems** - Fixed Jest mock hoisting issues for ical.js
4. **Diagnostic script updates** - Updated debug scripts to use new ical.js API

## Results
✅ All ical service tests passing (13/13)
✅ Integration tests working correctly  
✅ Live diagnostic shows successful connection to calendars (852 events retrieved)
✅ No more compilation errors in the ical integration

## Status: COMPLETED
The ical integration issues have been successfully resolved. The system is now fully functional with the new ical.js library providing proper recurring event handling.
