# 2522-Briefly: Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Briefly project - a Telegram bot that integrates Todoist tasks and iCal calendar events, using gpt-4.1-mini for intelligent task grouping and formatted messaging.

## Architecture
The project follows Clean Architecture principles with a strict structure:

```
/lib
  /core
    /config             # API keys, environment configs
    /utils              # Utility helpers
    /services           # Todoist, iCal, Telegram integrations
    /models             # Task and calendar data models
    /exceptions         # Custom error handling
  /logic
    /grouping           # GPT logic for task grouping
    /messaging          # GPT prompt logic for Telegram messaging
/test
  /unit
  /integration
  /mocks
```

## Implementation Approach
Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:
1. Write tests first for each component
2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage

## Core Components
1. **Models**: Task and CalendarEvent with immutable data structures
2. **Services**: External API integrations (Todoist, iCal, Telegram, OpenAI)
3. **Logic**: Business logic for message formatting and task grouping
4. **Config**: Secure configuration management with encryption

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core components (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests for external API interactions
- Mocks for external services to enable offline testing

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of API keys using encryption
- No plaintext secrets in code or logs
- Privacy-focused design with minimal data retention
